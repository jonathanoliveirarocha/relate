# Relate

Relate is a space designed for those who are curious and passionate about three universes that, at first glance, may seem completely disconnected: Astronomy, technology and music. What do these themes have in common? At Relate, we believe that it is love that unites them â€“ the love of knowledge, innovation and creativity.
